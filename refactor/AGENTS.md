# Refactor Spike

## Maintenance Rule

- Treat this file as living project memory for the refactor spike.
- Add durable instructions here when the user gives guidance that should apply throughout future maintenance of this spike.
- Keep temporary debugging notes, one-off task state, and stale implementation details out of this file.

## Current Direction

- Call the long-lived process the server, not the host.
- Keep this foundation small: CLI commands, appsettings, logging, and server/client request-response communication only.
- Organize the spike by responsibility: `Runtime`, `Hosting`, `Settings`,
  `Forwarding`, `Steam`, `Inputs`, `Outputs`, and `cli`.
- Keep active-client and receiver-process ownership in the separate `Runtime`
  project. Do not fold it into Hosting.
- Keep client, server, request/response protocol, and named-pipe lifecycle management in `Hosting`.
- Organize internal server code by server responsibility:
  `Inputs` for server-owned input pumps, `Outputs` for server output
  composition/fallbacks, `Pipes` for named-pipe sessions and per-client pipe
  loops, `Runtime` for active-client orchestration, `Sessions` for connected
  client/profile state, and `Status` for server status models.
- Organize Hosting around product concepts, not implementation leftovers:
  `Server` for the long-lived process and server-side orchestration, `Client`
  for the Steam-launched/profile client lifecycle, and `Transport` or `Shared`
  only for pipe/RPC plumbing. Avoid generic names such as `Runner`, `Tools`,
  `Manager`, or `Helper` unless the file is genuinely tiny glue.
- Keep app-facing hosting classes readable first; move per-connection plumbing into internal helper types when it starts hiding the public contract.
- Keep `HostServer` focused on server lifetime and pipe acceptance.
  Connected-client state, profile run state, status, and runtime updates belong
  in `ServerSessions`; pipe RPC target code should talk to `ServerSessions`, not
  to the app-facing server object.
- In `Hosting`, keep user-facing public types at the project root. Put internal protocol, pipe, connection, and registry plumbing under `Shared`.
- Keep `ClientConnection` focused on connection lifecycle. Server API calls such as status belong on `VirtualMouseClient` and use the connection pipe internally.
- Keep server-owned status construction on server state/root server code. `ServerConnection` should dispatch status requests, not decide what status contains.
- Endpoint request mapping belongs on `HostServer` until it is large enough to deserve a dedicated router. `ServerConnection` only owns pipe connection lifecycle and delegates post-connect requests.
- Before adding code, inspect the full pipeline and place behavior where that responsibility already belongs; do not add code to a nearby file just because it is convenient.
- When moving or flattening files, update project names, assembly names,
  namespaces, scripts, solution entries, and friend assembly names so no stale
  historical responsibility name survives the move.
- Before adding new behavior, first name the product concept that owns it, then
  place the code under that concept. Do not create generic runner/helper/tool
  files as a parking lot for workflow logic.
- Treat foundation code as permanent. Do not defer organization with "clean it
  later"; if the current organization cannot absorb a feature cleanly, fix the
  organization before adding the feature.
- If a file named for a responsibility exists, put that responsibility there. For example, client connection/open/reconnect/clear/dispose logic belongs in `ClientConnection`, not `VirtualMouseClient`.
- Do not make plumbing public to satisfy constructor or test convenience. Keep `ClientConnection` and connection liveness calls internal; expose only the app-facing `VirtualMouseClient` surface.
- Document public interfaces with concise XML docs and do not suppress missing XML documentation warnings for refactor projects.
- Section marker separator comments must be exactly 79 characters long, ending on column 79.
- Treat `VirtualMouseClient` as an object callers instantiate, connect, call, wait, and dispose.
- Keep profiles as server-side configuration loaded from the shared appsettings file; do not expose profile list/get IPC until a server workflow needs it.
- Keep app-wide settings in the `Settings` project. Profiles are a `Settings.Profiles` folder/namespace that owns only game profile options and profile lookup/reload behavior.
- Settings expose a `VirtualMouseSettings` root object. CLI composition should call Settings registration instead of binding random settings types directly.
- Keep settings models, settings service, and dependency injection registration in separate files.
- Keep settings validation minimal and centralized in `Settings`; feature services should not duplicate root validation.
- Settings reload notifications belong to the root `ApplicationSettingsService`; feature services such as profiles should observe that root service and project their own slice without exposing duplicate change events.
- Keep settings file path ownership in the root `Settings` layer. `ProfilesService` should not accept, expose, or log the settings file path.
- Profiles choose output explicitly with separate `ControllerOutput` and `MouseOutput` values. Do not reintroduce a vague combined output mode.
- Resolve raw game profile settings through a simple helper, not a DI service. The resolver owns runtime defaults such as title, working directory, receiver process names, and environment-expanded paths.
- Put app-owned settings under the `VirtualMouse` root in appsettings. Do not use top-level `Logging` for app settings; it is owned by Microsoft.Extensions.Logging provider configuration.
- Keep `refactor/app/Cli/appsettings.json` as a practical starter config: small,
  usable, and not just empty defaults. Keep `refactor/app/Cli/appsettings.example.json`
  as the compact complete reference with every supported field assigned a
  meaningful value that demonstrates the setting.
- Keep the refactor executable as one `refactor/app/VirtualMouse.csproj`.
  Mode-specific code stays under `Cli`, `Tray`, and `Shortcut`.
- File logging is configured from `VirtualMouse:Logging:LogFile` at startup. Do not add reloadable logging until a real workflow needs it.
- Keep useful smoke checks as repeatable tests under `tests`, and expose them through `script/test.ps1`.
- `refactor/script/build.ps1` is the commit-validation build for the refactor
  spike. It should format and build `refactor/Refactor.slnx` so MSBuild sees one
  project graph instead of repeatedly building shared dependencies.
- Do not add profiles, routes, input devices, output devices, or session orchestration until the communication foundation is stable.
- Status commands should use the normal client-to-running-server pipe path, not direct access to an in-process server object.
- Use `StreamJsonRpc` for Hosting server/client communication. Do not
  reintroduce manual request envelopes, method-name dispatch helpers, or
  custom request/response pipe protocols.
- Public wording should say active client, not active run. Do not add run ids
  until one connected client can actually manage multiple games.
- Receiver process lists are ANY-match lists. The client reports all matching
  receiver pids; Runtime claims pids first-client-wins and may let one client
  own multiple pids.
- Receiver processes are the primary game lifetime signal. A profile executable
  is only an optional startup hint; it may exit immediately or only launch
  another process.
- Receiver process claims are routing/activation state, not process ownership
  or kill permission. Only stop processes the client actually launched or
  explicitly owns.
- Keep OS process observation and cleanup outside `Runtime`; Runtime is only
  active-client and receiver-pid ownership state.
- Keep input/output routing in `Forwarding`, not `Hosting` or `Runtime`.
  `Forwarding` owns logical controller slots, active-client output gates, output
  device lifetime, Steam-preferred feature merge, and feedback fallback.
- Keep canonical hot-path report models and source-to-output mappers in
  `Forwarding`. Adapter projects such as `Inputs/Sdl` and `Outputs/Viiper`
  should translate between device libraries and those canonical models only.
- Model each controller as one logical slot with a Steam endpoint and a physical
  endpoint. Prefer Steam Input for every readable/writable feature, and use the
  physical endpoint only when the Steam endpoint is unavailable or does not
  support that feature.
- Keep future controller features such as LEDs, touchpads, adaptive triggers,
  and similar device-specific behavior as feature groups on the logical
  controller slot. Do not create per-feature route/session abstractions unless a
  real workflow proves the single-slot model insufficient.
- Runtime controller toggles should gate feature groups, not attach or detach
  the whole physical controller endpoint. Physical motion is the first such
  gate; the physical endpoint remains available for matching, feedback fallback,
  and other supported feature groups.
- Controller output devices stay connected while any attached client endpoint
  wants that output kind. Active-client state gates report forwarding, not
  virtual-device lifetime. Dispose the output only when no attached clients need
  it or output is explicitly disabled.
- Treat controller feedback such as rumble as held state owned by the logical
  controller slot. Replay it when the selected endpoint reconnects or changes,
  and send zero feedback to the old endpoint when it stops being the target.
- Controller endpoint capabilities must be truthful. Do not claim rumble,
  motion, touchpad, light, or adaptive-trigger support unless the source or
  output can actually handle that feature group.
- SDL gamepad indices are transport-local and can change between discovery
  calls. Use them only for the current client controller pipe snapshot; clear
  stale client controller endpoints whenever the client re-registers
  controllers.
- Client-launched game processes should be attached to a Windows kill-on-close
  job when possible. Do not kill receiver processes just because this client
  observed or claimed them.
- Keep per-report controller traffic on the `Forwarding` fixed binary pipe
  model. Do not send hot-path controller reports through JSON-RPC.
- `Hosting` owns controller pipe lifetime for connected clients, but pipe frames
  must flow into `Forwarding.ControllerBroker`; do not put merge, output, or
  feature fallback policy in Hosting.
- Output feedback sent back to client controller streams must not block broker
  output callbacks. Use pipe-owned asynchronous delivery or an explicit queue.
- Server-side active-client orchestration lives in `Hosting/Server`. It observes
  the foreground process id, updates `ActiveClientRegistry`, and dispatches
  active-client changes through simple callbacks. Do not add tiny reaction
  wrapper types until there are multiple real reactions with different behavior.
- Steam Input forcing is a server-side active-client reaction. On active-client
  changes, clear the forced app id first, then apply the new active client's
  Steam app id when present.
- Keep refactor Steam integration in `refactor/src/Steam`. Do not reference
  legacy `src/SteamInput` from refactor projects.
- Keep refactor input/output adapters in `refactor/src/Inputs` and
  `refactor/src/Outputs`. Do not reference legacy adapter projects from
  refactor projects.
- Keep HidHide integration in `refactor/src/HidHide`. Hosting may route active
  controller route identities and receiver executable paths into HidHide, but
  profile settings should not contain HidHide device instance paths.
- HidHide should hide physical controllers automatically for active controller
  routes that are forwarding to a VIIPER controller output. Derive the physical
  device from the route's physical controller id, not from user-entered paths.
- Keep Teensy wired as an output adapter placeholder until the transport is
  designed. It may expose selectable output options, but send operations should
  fail explicitly with `NotImplementedException`.
- Keep adapter-specific loopback policy out of `Inputs/Sdl`. SDL discovery may
  accept a caller filter, but Hosting owns the app-specific decision to ignore
  VIIPER-created virtual controllers.
- Server-owned input pumps and client controller streams should survive SDL
  disconnects by disposing stale sources, retrying discovery, and updating
  status instead of ending the whole server or client run.
- Keep Steam ROM Manager export in the refactor Steam project; CLI commands only
  orchestrate it from appsettings and print the result.
- The default Steam ROM Manager manifest path lives at
  `VirtualMouse:Steam:SrmExportPath`; CLI export arguments may override it.
- Steam shortcuts should target `VirtualMouse.exe shortcut <profile>` for normal
  profile launches. Keep CLI diagnostics as explicit command modes on the same
  executable.
- `refactor/script/deploy.ps1` publishes the single app executable into
  `refactor/deploy`. The app project owns publish content such as appsettings;
  `appsettings.json` should copy on build and publish, while
  `appsettings.example.json` should publish only. The script should only choose
  publish options, clean the output folder, and publish into it. Disable XML
  documentation generation for deploy through the publish command rather than
  deleting or filtering published files.
- Keep `SteamInputClient`'s public API narrow: `DesktopConfigAppId`,
  `ListGames`, `ResolveAppIdFromEnvironment`, `ForceConfigAsync(uint?)`, and
  `OpenControllerConfigAsync(uint)`. CLI commands expose desktop and clearing
  by passing `DesktopConfigAppId` or null rather than adding more SteamInput
  methods.
