## Purpose

This repository is Steam Input Bridge (`steam-input-bridge`): a .NET app for
Steam Input orchestration and local input forwarding to physical or virtual
output transports.

Keep discussion and code scoped to this repository.

## Maintenance

Treat this file as living project memory.

- Update it when a durable project rule, convention, or decision changes.
- Add only guidance likely to matter again.
- Keep temporary notes, debugging details, and one-off tasks out of this file.
- Keep it concise enough to be useful.

## Stack

- .NET 10
- C# 14 via the SDK default
- VS Code solution support through `SteamInputBridge.slnx`

Do not set `LangVersion=latest`.

## Layout

- `SteamInputBridge`: one backend library project, `SteamInputBridge.csproj`
- `SteamInputBridge/Forwarding`: reports, brokers, mappings, and controller pipe frames
- `SteamInputBridge/HidHide`: HidHide command integration and profile firewall behavior
- `SteamInputBridge/Hosting`: server/client IPC, route orchestration, active-run handling
- `SteamInputBridge/Inputs/RawInput`: Windows Raw Input mouse source
- `SteamInputBridge/Inputs/Sdl`: SDL controller source and Steam/physical matching
- `SteamInputBridge/Outputs/Teensy`: planned Teensy output transport
- `SteamInputBridge/Outputs/Viiper`: VIIPER virtual output transports
- `SteamInputBridge/Runtime`: process launch, receiver discovery, foreground checks, jobs
- `SteamInputBridge/Settings`: app settings, profiles, validation, file logging
- `SteamInputBridge/Shortcuts`: global keyboard shortcut parsing and Windows hotkeys
- `SteamInputBridge/Steam`: Steam Input control, game discovery, shortcut export helpers
- `SteamInputBridge.App`: executable with tray, shortcut, and CLI modes
- `SteamInputBridge.Tests`: unified test project
- `firmware`: microcontroller-side code
- `scripts`: build, test, CLI, and deploy scripts

## Architecture

- Keep the API small and build only the MVP for this repository.
- Prefer direct pass-through over abstraction layers.
- Prefer maintained first-party or popular libraries when they reduce repo
  complexity.
- Keep input contracts under `SteamInputBridge/Inputs` and output contracts
  under `SteamInputBridge/Outputs`; inputs must not depend on outputs.
- Keep source-to-output orchestration in `SteamInputBridge/Hosting` and shared
  forwarding contracts/mapping in `SteamInputBridge/Forwarding`.
- Keep CLI-only diagnostics, probes, and benchmarks under `SteamInputBridge.App/Cli`
  or `SteamInputBridge.Tests`, not in the backend library.
- Do not add buffering, smoothing, batching, retries, or background pipelines
  unless explicitly requested.
- Treat 1000 Hz mouse-rate input and sub-2-5 ms added latency as hot-path
  design targets.
- Keep hot paths free of avoidable allocations, logging, JSON, and RPC.
- Use `SteamInputBridge` as the root settings section and named-pipe identity.
- Treat `ARCHITECTURE.md` as reference material, not binding design, when it
  conflicts with this file.

## Host And Client Model

- Prefer one local host process for production forwarding.
- The host owns Raw Input, VIIPER outputs, active-run gating, route-local
  feedback, profile resolution, foreground selection, and cleanup.
- Clients launch or attach one profile run, read client-visible SDL controllers,
  stream controller reports to the host, handle route-local feedback, and
  release their run normally.
- Host IPC is control-only except for client-to-host controller report pipes.
  Do not forward mouse report traffic over IPC unless explicitly revisited.
- Support multiple client runs. Only the foreground/needed run should drive
  outputs at a time.
- Disconnecting a client releases only that client run and its routes.
- Separate durable configuration from runtime state. Profiles, controllers,
  games, and global settings are configuration; client runs, controller routes,
  process ids, and created device ids are state.
- Treat receiver processes as the primary game lifetime signal. A profile
  executable is only a startup hint and may exit immediately.
- Only stop processes this repository launched or explicitly owns.
- Keep process launch, receiver discovery, foreground checks, and kill helpers
  in `SteamInputBridge/Runtime`; Hosting orchestrates them.
- Keep active-client state and receiver-process claims in
  `ActiveClientRegistry`; server loops own side effects such as forwarding gates
  and Steam forcing.

## Inputs

- Raw Input is the mouse source and runs inside the host process.
- Keep Raw Input Win32 interop as one coherent manual boundary. Do not use
  CsWin32 for it.
- Raw Input filtering is caller-driven; do not bake Steam-specific assumptions
  into `Inputs.RawInput`.
- SDL is the controller source. Use event-driven SDL reads, not a polling loop.
- Treat Steam-routed SDL controllers and physical SDL controllers as different
  discovered devices.
- Steam-launched clients first read exactly the SDL controllers Steam exposes,
  without clearing Steam-provided SDL hiding/filter flags.
- Clear SDL hiding/filter flags only as a fallback after selecting the primary
  controller and only to recover missing features such as motion.
- Match physical fallback controllers generically, such as exact VID/PID
  matching. Do not hardcode controller model VID/PID mappings in `src`.
- Physical companions are route-local, not a global controller slot registry.
- Each open `SdlGamepadSource` owns its own SDL runtime lease.

## Outputs

- VIIPER is the main virtual output handoff target.
- The host is the only process that writes to VIIPER outputs.
- Use one VIIPER created-device model: create one route-specific output device
  on connect and remove it on dispose.
- Mark created VIIPER devices with fixed route-specific VID/PID pairs and
  reclaim only owned devices on startup.
- Enforce one active VIIPER owner with an async-safe named ownership primitive.
- Remove VIIPER devices and buses before waiting on connected streams to
  dispose.
- Xbox 360 output uses Microsoft `045E:028E`; DS4 output should use Sony
  `054C:05C4` unless a newer DS4 profile specifically needs `054C:09CC`.
- Fail on unsupported output ranges rather than silently clamping.
- Route rumble feedback back through the exact controller route that owns the
  virtual output.
- Teensy 4.0 is planned but not implemented; placeholders may throw
  `NotImplementedException`.

## HidHide

- Keep HidHide integration in `SteamInputBridge/HidHide`.
- Profiles should select output behavior, not store HidHide device paths.
- HidHide firewall behavior should derive hidden physical devices from active
  forwarded routes.
- VIIPER devices should not leak to unrelated processes; expose them only where
  the active profile needs them.

## Steam And Shortcuts

- Product scope is Steam shortcut orchestration and forwarding Steam-visible
  input into games that do not handle it correctly.
- Keep Steam Input configuration forcing as activation orchestration, not
  per-report forwarding logic.
- Keep Steam file parsing in `SteamInputBridge/Steam`; read local Steam files
  defensively and cover parsers with fake Steam directories in tests.
- Use `ValveKeyValue` for Steam VDF parsing.
- Keep the Steam Input control API caller-facing: force config, clear forcing,
  open controller config, list games, and export shortcuts.
- Steam shortcut targets use `SteamInputBridge.exe shortcut <profile>`.
- Keyboard shortcuts are global server settings, not per-game behavior.
- Shortcuts only set direct gates such as `Motion` and `Pointer` to
  `Enabled` or `Disabled`. Steam Input owns hold/toggle/action-layer behavior.

## CLI And Scripts

- Keep CLI, tray, and shortcut modes in `SteamInputBridge.App/SteamInputBridge.App.csproj`.
- CLI groups are `server`, `client`, `steam`, and `test`.
- Daily forwarding stays under `client run <profile>`.
- Diagnostics such as probes, raw input viewers, nullifiers, and benchmarks stay
  under `test`, not product-facing command groups.
- Do not add alternate CLI aliases before a release.
- CLI output should be concise, aligned, and value-first.
- `scripts/Build-Solution.ps1`: format and build `SteamInputBridge.slnx`
- `scripts/Test-Solution.ps1`: run `SteamInputBridge.Tests/SteamInputBridge.Tests.csproj`
- `scripts/CLI.ps1`: run the SteamInputBridge CLI mode
- `scripts/Deploy-App.ps1`: publish `SteamInputBridge.App/SteamInputBridge.App.csproj`

## Testing

- Add tests for new behavior as it is added.
- Use tests while developing, not only at the end.
- Keep tests focused on behavior and mapping, not internal structure.
- Keep all tests in `SteamInputBridge.Tests/SteamInputBridge.Tests.csproj`.

## Logging

- Do not write to console directly from library code.
- Do not create or manage log files from library code.
- Use `ILogger` only for lifecycle events.
- Do not log per-report hot-path traffic.
- File logging belongs in app/settings plumbing, not low-level libraries.

## Style

- Keep things concise.
- Avoid self-referential wording like "minimal" in project-facing text.
- Use explicit `using` directives.
- Prefer clear names over over-general names.
- Prefer a small number of coherent files over many tiny files when types are
  tightly related.
- Avoid single-model-per-file layouts for small related contracts, options,
  status records, log helpers, or leases.
- Do not leave near-empty migration artifact files.
- Do not add private helpers that only wrap a constructor, null check, simple
  property access, or one obvious call.
- Do not place source files under dot-prefixed folders in SDK-style projects.

## Section Markers

Use section markers only when they help structure a source file.

```csharp
// MARK: Section Name
// ========================================================================
```

The full separator line, including the leading `// `, must be exactly 79
characters wide.
